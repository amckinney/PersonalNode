# Alex McKinney's Personal Website

A website I am building to provide information about myself and improve my web development skills. <br />

This is still a work in progress. I am working on migrating my Polls application (found at the MyWebSite repo) into this one, so I am currently refactoring the PHP code to work in Node. I feel that this is a good way to get familiar with the MEAN Stack before tackling more complex applications. <br />

I hope you enjoy it!
